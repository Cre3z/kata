I created this repo to keep track of all the JavaScript challenges I complete on Codewars.com. 

Each js file contains a challenge description, my solution I had for the challenge and at least two other possible solutions that were interesting, very different from mine and taught me a thing or two. 

I try to do these as much as possible to keep my skills sharp and current. Since I primarily work in frontend development with JS frameworks these sort of challenges help me become a better developer and to see new solutions to potential and current problems in my code. It is also a great opportunity to learn from other developers whether it be through code or their perspectives on things.

I would also like to thank everyone on codewars.com for sharing their ideas and participating in the kata community. I know, I not only speak for myself but for other devs out there too, your efforts are greatly appreciated!
